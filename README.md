# push_swap

**push_swap** is a project developed at 42. The goal of this project is to sort a stack of integers with a limited set of operations, using the least number of moves possible. This project teaches fundamental concepts of algorithm design, optimization, and complexity analysis.

## Project Objectives

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implement efficient sorting algorithms tailored to the constraints of the project.
- **Stack Manipulation**: Use stack data structures to perform sorting operations.
- **Optimization**: Minimize the number of operations required to sort the stack.
- **Complexity Analysis**: Analyze and improve the time and space complexity of your sorting solution.

## Operations

You are provided with two stacks, `a` and `b`, and a set of operations to manipulate these stacks:

- `sa` : Swap the first two elements at the top of stack `a`.
- `sb` : Swap the first two elements at the top of stack `b`.
- `ss` : `sa` and `sb` at the same time.
- `pa` : Take the first element at the top of `b` and put it at the top of `a`.
- `pb` : Take the first element at the top of `a` and put it at the top of `b`.
- `ra` : Shift all elements of stack `a` up by one.
- `rb` : Shift all elements of stack `b` up by one.
- `rr` : `ra` and `rb` at the same time.
- `rra` : Shift all elements of stack `a` down by one.
- `rrb` : Shift all elements of stack `b` down by one.
- `rrr` : `rra` and `rrb` at the same time.
